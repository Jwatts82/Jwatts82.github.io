After completing the third module in my software engineering course at Flatiron School it was time to tackle another project! This project was completed using what we learned about Rails.  
This app was created with the idea of being able to keep track of your gift lists and all the gifts needing purchased.
<br>
The first thing I did was install Devise and this “gem” is really a gem!  By utilizing Devise and OAuth my app was capable of enabling third party log in, sign up and log out.
<br>
<br>
Next it was on to the MVC of the project:
<br>
<br>
Models:<br>
The app had 3 models creating relationships between users, lists and gifts.
<br>
<br>
Controllers:<br>
Gift Guide has 5 controllers which contain the logic that gets executed and displayed in the views. <br>
The controllers are:<br>
Application, Callbacks (OAuth), <br>
Registrations (handles sign up), <br>
Gift (creates, displays, and edits gifts), <br>
List (displays logged in user lists).<br>

Views:<br>
The views contain the HTML responsible for the functioning and view of the app.
